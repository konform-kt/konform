## Pull Request Requirements

Always use pull requests for changes:
- Never push directly to main branch
- Create a PR for all changes, even small ones
- Use descriptive branch names

## Pull Request Descriptions

Keep PR descriptions compact and to the point:
- Maximum 2-3 bullet points in summary
- Avoid verbose explanations or redundant information
- Focus on what changed and why, not how
- Use concise language without unnecessary detail
